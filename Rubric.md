Project 4: Provenance Guard
Total Points: 25pts + 4pts bonus

Required Features
3pts	Content Submission Endpoint
1	Demo or source shows a text submission to the API returning a structured JSON response.
1	The response includes an attribution result and a confidence score.
1	The response includes transparency label text (not just a raw score).
2pts	Multi-Signal Detection Pipeline
1	README names 2 or more detection signals and explains what each one captures — not just what tool was used, but what property of the text it measures, and what each signal misses.
1	Demo or source shows results that reference or visibly reflect both signals (e.g., individual signal scores shown alongside the combined score).
2pts	Confidence Scoring with Uncertainty
1	Demo or source shows at least two submissions with noticeably different confidence scores — a high-confidence case and a lower-confidence case.
1	README explains how signals are combined into a confidence score and includes some description of how the student validated that scores are meaningful (e.g., tested inputs that should produce different scores, or described the thresholds separating label categories).
3pts	Transparency Label
1	README includes the transparency label's actual text, written out as a quoted string or a markdown table of the variants (a screenshot or mockup is optional; the written-out text is what's required).
1	The label uses plain language — no jargon like "classifier output" or "logit score." A non-technical reader could understand what it means.
1	The label visibly differs between high-confidence and low-confidence results — different text, not just a different number.
2pts	Appeals Workflow
1	Demo or source shows an appeal being submitted with creator reasoning included.
1	Demo or source shows the content's status updated to "under review" and the appeal visible in the audit log.
2pts	Rate Limiting
1	Demo or source shows rate limiting in action — what happens when the limit is hit (e.g., a 429 response or an error message).
1	README documents the specific limits chosen and provides reasoning tied to realistic usage patterns on a writing platform — not just "I used the default."
3pts	Audit Log
1	Demo or source shows the audit log with at least 3 entries; each entry visibly includes the attribution result, confidence score, and timestamp.
1	Log format is structured — JSON, a table, or a formatted log file. Unformatted console output does not qualify.
1	At least one appeal is visible in the log, showing the appeal alongside the original classification entry.
4pts	planning.md
1	Detection signals are described with explanation of what each measures and how their outputs are combined.
1	Uncertainty representation is addressed — specific thresholds or score ranges are defined, not just "it will show a score."
1	Transparency label variants are written out for at least the high-confidence AI, uncertain, and high-confidence human cases.
1	Appeals workflow and at least two anticipated edge cases are described with enough specificity to be useful pre-work; an ## AI Tool Plan section identifies at least one milestone where AI tools will be used for code generation, specifying what spec sections and diagram will be provided as input.
2pts	README
1	Known limitations section names at least one specific content type the system would likely misclassify, with explanation tied to the signals — not a generic disclaimer.
1	Spec reflection is present and substantive — describes a real way implementation diverged from the plan and why.
2pts	AI Usage
1	Section describes at least 2 specific instances of AI tool use: what the student directed the AI to do and what the output was.
1	Each instance includes what the student revised, overrode, or decided differently — not just "I used AI to write this function."
